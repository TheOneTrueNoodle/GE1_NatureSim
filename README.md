# Description
Out project is designed around exploring the emergence of new environments generated from procedural generation, and how those environments can spread and grow. By combining simple behaviours with AI and state machines for the natural environment, we have attempted to simulate an infinite world that can changes based on the input of variables that affect terrain generation.

# Instructions
Fork and clone this repo to your computer to get access to the full project. Then you can open the scene: "Assets/Scenes/Terrain Menu Screen". When you press play you can change the settings for how the generation will be built and see what different results you can get, or if you wish to have more control over changes you can go to the "Assets/Terrain Assets" folder and edit the custom noise and terrain scriptable objects directly, as well as adding new regions or changing the Animation Curve that renders the differences in height.
